Builds lightweight `MemberDeclaration` from discovery info.

## Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|

## Output Type

`MemberDeclaration`

## Build Logic

Converts `MemberDiscoveryInfo` to `MemberDeclaration`:
- Calculates line number from position using converter
- Copies name, kind, visibility, isAnnotated
- Discards syntax node reference

## Usage

Used by `TypeDeclarationBuilder` for check operations where syntax nodes are not needed.
